      <p>
        Mmmhh Mmmhhh Mmmhh
        You've got a hold on me
        Don't even know your power
        I stand a hundred feet
        But I fall when I'm around you

        Show me an open door
        Then you go and slam it on me
        I can't take anymore
        I'm saying baby...

        Please have mercy on me
        Take it easy on my heart
        Even though you don't mean to hurt me
        You keep tearing me apart
        Would you please have mercy...
        Mercy on my heart?
        Would you please have mercy...
        Mercy on my heart?

        Id drive through the night
        Just to be near you, baby
        Heart old and testified
        Tell me that Im not crazy

        Im not asking for a lot
        Just that youre honest with me
        My pride is all I got
        Im saying, baby...

        Please have mercy on me
        Take it easy on my heart
        Even though you dont mean to hurt me
        You keep tearing me apart
        Would you please have mercy on me?
        Im a puppet on your string

        And even though you got good intentions
        I need you to set me free
        Would you please have mercy...
        Mercy on my heart?
        Would you please have mercy...
        Mercy on my heart?

        Consuming all the air inside my lungs
        Ripping all the skin from off my bones
        Im prepared to sacrifice my life
        I would gladly do it twice

        Consuming all the air inside my lungs
        Ripping all the skin from off my bones
        Im prepared to sacrifice my life
        I would gladly do it twice

        Oh, please have mercy on me
        Take it easy on my heart
        Even though you dont mean to hurt me
        You keep tearing me apart
        Would you please have mercy on me?

        Im a puppet on your string
        And even though you got good intentions
        I need you to set me free

        Im begging you for mercy, mercy
        Begging you, begging you, please, baby
        Im begging you for mercy, mercy
        Ooh, Im begging you, Im begging you, yeah
        Mmmhh... Mmhhh... Mmhh
